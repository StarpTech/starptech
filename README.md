## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dustin Deus, and I have over ten years of experience in software engineering and research. Throughout my career, I've developed a passion for creating innovative software that developers love. I've tackled complex challenges, including designing and implementing **API Gateways**, **Proxies**, and **Web Applications**, as well as developing and operating comprehensive modern **SaaS Solutions** like [WunderGraph Cosmo](https://wundergraph.com/).

In addition to pursuing new technical challenges, I've been actively involved in building and leading teams. Mentoring and guiding others to success has been an incredibly rewarding experience for me.

This journey has led me to become the Co-Founder & CTO at WunderGraph, where I guide our team by providing technical direction and support. I am a strong advocate for Open Source and have actively contributed to numerous projects over the years, including WunderGraph Cosmo, HemeraJs, Fastify, Next.js, Open Telemetry, and many more. I am constantly seeking new ways to contribute to the community and build projects that have the potential to evolve into something impactful.

At WunderGraph, we're building the complete solution to build, manage, and deploy federated GraphQL APIs. GraphQL is the technology companies need to facilitate the development of a unified API layer that can be consumed not only by users but also by internal teams to accelerate innovation in companies. Data is the new oil, and we're here to help companies leverage their data in a more efficient way.
