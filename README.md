## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dustin Deus, I'm Co-Founder & CTO at [WunderGraph](https://wundergraph.com). I have over a decade experience in software engineering and architecture. Throughout my career, I've developed a passion for creating innovative software that developers love. I've worked on complex challenges, including designing and implementing **API Gateways**, **Proxies**, and **Web Applications**.

At WunderGraph, we're building the complete solution to build, manage, and deploy federated GraphQL APIs. You can use our [**Cloud**](https://cosmo.wundergraph.com/) or run the whole stack On-Prem. GraphQL is the technology companies need to facilitate the development of a unified API layer that can be consumed not only by users but also by internal teams to accelerate innovation in companies. **Data is the new oil**, and we're here to help companies leverage their data in a more efficient way.

If this sounds interesting to you, [we're hiring](https://wundergraph.com/jobs)!
